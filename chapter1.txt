Whispering Breeze
Whispering breeze, soft and light,
Caresses the leaves, takes flight.
Through the trees, it gently weaves,
A melody that the heart receives.

In its breath, secrets unfold,
Stories untold, yet to be told.
It carries dreams on its gentle wings,
As it dances and softly sings.

Listen closely, hear its tale,
Of love, of hope, it will unveil.
Let it touch your soul with grace,
Embracing you in its tender embrace.


Starry Night
In the depths of the night, a canvas unfolds,
A tapestry of stars, glittering and bold.
Each one a beacon, a distant light,
Guiding us through the darkest night.

Constellations form stories in the sky,
Whispering legends as time goes by.
A celestial dance, so vast and grand,
Painting beauty across the cosmic land.

Gaze upon the heavens, feel the awe,
As stars twinkle, in silent applause.
Let their brilliance ignite your dreams,
In this starry night, endless it seems.
