Whispering Breeze
Whispering breeze, soft and light,
Caresses the leaves, takes flight.
Through the trees, it gently weaves,
A melody that the heart receives.

In its breath, secrets unfold,
Stories untold, yet to be told.
It carries dreams on its gentle wings,
As it dances and softly sings.

Listen closely, hear its tale,
Of love, of hope, it will unveil.
Let it touch your soul with grace,
Embracing you in its tender embrace.
